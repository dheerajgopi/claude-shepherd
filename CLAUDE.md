# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A Claude Code **plugin** packaging engineering workflows as skills and commands. It is not TDD-specific — strict TDD is the first skill; more skills/commands will be added. Each skill is self-contained under `skills/<name>/`, with its outer-loop command in `commands/`.

## Commands

```bash
# one-time dev setup
uv venv .venv && uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python claude-agent-sdk pytest pyyaml

.venv/bin/pytest                          # full suite (no API calls — fake SDK seam)
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_loop3.py      # one file
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_loop3.py -k escalation   # one test by keyword

claude --plugin-dir /path/to/harness      # load the plugin surface in a scratch project
bin/setup.sh                              # install into a target project (run from ITS root)
```

The TDD engine CLI (run from a target project root): `python3 skills/tdd/scripts/tdd.py init|new|run|status`.

## Architecture

**The contracts module is the single source of truth.** `skills/tdd/scripts/tdd_contracts.py` (stdlib-only) pins everything two modules could disagree on: exit codes, phases + legal transitions (`PHASE_TRANSITIONS` — the state store refuses anything else), on-disk schemas, CLI grammar, commit formats, and the `AgentRunner` protocol. Import it; never re-derive these values. `docs/contracts.md` is its prose companion for artifacts that can't import Python (SKILL.md, the command, setup.sh, prompts) — keep the two in sync.

**Checkpoint state machine.** `tdd.py run` executes headlessly via the Claude Agent SDK and exits with a distinct code whenever human input is needed (0 done, 10 awaiting approval, 11 coverage gap, 12 escalated, 13 budget exceeded, 20–22 resolution errors). The outer command (`commands/tdd.md`) interprets `$?`, gathers the human decision with AskUserQuestion, and re-invokes with `--decision approve|reject [--feedback …]`. The engine resumes the same SDK session (`resume=<session_id>`) to preserve the prompt-cache prefix. The exit code is the protocol; informational output goes to stdout, errors to stderr.

**Three loops** (`tdd_loop1.py` → `tdd_loop3.py`): Gherkin spec → test generation (traceability matrix, red commit) → implementation (green commit). Loop boundaries are **hooks, not prompts**: a PreToolUse path policy (pure decision function `is_path_allowed` in `tdd_hooks.py`) makes cross-boundary edits impossible — Loops 1–2 are ALLOW_ONLY (gherkin/ resp. `test.paths`), Loop 3 is DENY_UNDER those same paths. Test edits in Loop 3 go through an escalation channel; approved escalations re-enter Loops 1–2 and produce `red(n)` commits.

**The SDK seam.** Loops never import the SDK directly — they depend on the `AgentRunner` protocol. Production uses `SdkAgentRunner` (`tdd_agent.py`); tests script `FakeAgentRunner` (`tdd_fake_runner.py`), selected in subprocess tests via the `TDD_RUNNER=fake:<script.json>` env var. The fake routes simulated file writes through the real path-policy function, so it exercises the same mechanical boundary as production. Verified SDK behavior (resume, hooks deny shape, settings isolation, budgets) is documented in `docs/sdk-notes.md` — those notes were live-verified; trust them over intuition.

**Automated commits** follow exact format strings: `tdd(<slug>): spec | red | red(<n>) | green` (see contracts module). Nothing outside the engine may create commits matching `tdd(...)`.

**Target-project footprint:** a `.harness/` workspace (config.yaml, manifest.json, one folder per feature; `state.json` is gitignored, traceability + reports are committed) and one `enabledPlugins` entry in `.claude/settings.json`. Branch convention: `tdd/<slug>`.

## Test-suite conventions

- Fixtures (`tests/conftest.py`) build their worlds with plain subprocess git + file writes — they must never call the engine's `init`/`new` (fixtures cannot depend on the code under test). `test_cli_exitcodes.py` is deliberately the only place the engine's verbs run as subprocesses; `test_e2e.py` drives full journeys through the CLI with fake-runner scripts.
- `skills/tdd/scripts/` is put on `sys.path` by conftest; engine modules are imported flat (`import tdd_contracts`), not as a package.

## Commit messages

Conventional prefixes (`feat`, `fix`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `build`). Describe what was implemented; no process details (test counts, parallel-track logistics, session/agent chatter).
